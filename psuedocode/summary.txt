Ohack Summer 2025

Created a system for document tagging, organization, and retrieval using prompt engineering, finetuning, and resource-augmented generation on Gemini model X
Utilized prompt engineering, finetuning, and RAG to improve document tagging accuracy from X% to X%
Utilized FILTER SYSTEM and further finetuning to train AI agent to carry out document retrieval related tasks
Utilized RAG to enable AI agent to generate report type X, report type Y, boosting worker efficiency by X%
