DOCUMENT TAGGING, ORGANIZATION, RETRIEVAL
------------------------------

Goal: 

Create an AI Agent to classify, organize, and retrieve documents in Heritage Square Google Drive.

Methods:

Google Gemini - pick for its integration with Google Drive API

Classification/Organization -

For each document,
1. Feed document contents and prompt asking to classify it into optimized LLM (using prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG).
2. LLM returns tag(s) (limited to tags provided by Heritage Square).
3. AI agent organizes file by appending date in format DDYYMM to end of file name.
4. AI Agent places file in appropriate folder based on tag.

Retrieval -

Given a user prompt asking for documents meeting specific parameters (specific tag, date range, etc.):
1. Create a NEW folder populated with all relevant documents related to user's search.
2. Provide user with brief summary of folder contents AND suggestions for which files are most relevant to a user's search.

IMPROVED AI AGENT OUTPUT
------------------------------

Google Gemini - pick for its integration with Google Drive API
DIFFERENT FROM CHATBOT PROCESSING DOCUMENTS

Goal: 

Improve Gemini output using LLM-specific optimizations

Methods:

Prompt Engineering - Use well-written, clear, concise prompts to guide LLM output to be relevant and effective
Fine-tuning - Create a dataset of sample responses to tune LLM output to match desired tone and format
Resource Augmented Generation (RAG) - Allow LLM to search Heritage Square's Google Drive to retrieve the top X relevant documents, will improve LLM output by introducing supplementary information.

Input - User prompt asking for Chatbot generation of a resource (ex. email, document, etc.)
Output - Relevant and accurate representation of requested resource
